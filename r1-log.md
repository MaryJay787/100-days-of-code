## Log

### R1D1
Started making a trivia game app. So far I've got some of the bones for the api and front-end together. Installed JEST to help me test my code. First time writing test code so we'll see how it goes. First step is figure out how to setup my testing environment.

### R1D2
Watched some videos on youtube about JEST and React. Also read some documentation on JEST. After adjusting my code from yesterday I started running into errors when I try to run npm test. Overall made some progress..I guess. 

### R1D3 
I ended up having to start from scratch...not too happy about that. However I did successfully install, configures and run some practice test so I guess I'm off to a great start.
