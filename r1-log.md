## Log

### R1D1
Started making a trivia game app. So far I've got some of the bones for the api and front-end together. Installed JEST to help me test my code. First time writing test code so we'll see how it goes. First step is figure out how to setup my testing environment.

### R1D2
Watched some videos on youtube about JEST and React. Also read some documentation on JEST. After adjusting my code from yesterday I started running into errors when I try to run npm test. Overall made some progress..I guess. 

### R1D3 
I ended up having to start from scratch...not too happy about that. However I did successfully install, configures and run some practice test so I guess I'm off to a great start. 

### R1D4
Following a react, jest, enzyme tutorial video but, also adjusting some of the code to fit my project. Which sorta turned out to be a fail because I wanted to use Semantic UI React for styling but it doesn't play well with jest and enzyme. I learned today that I have to brush up on my HTMl and CSS. Lots more to learn but making progress. 

### R1D5
Forgot to post this yesterday. But I am in the process of learning more about jest and enzyme. I also am trying to figure out what other programs I want to implement into my app. 

### R1D6
Spent sometime reading Enzyme docs and added some basics test to two of my components. I need to find some more jest and enzyme test tutorial videos to watch. 

### R1D7
Startig to plan out the layout of my app. 

### R1D8
Watched a video about building a react quiz and read some CSS docs on containers. Im also really tired so coding today was really hard. 

### R1D9
Was able to start wiring my frontend to my ruby api backend after reading some react docs.

### R1D10
Rewired routes for game component so I could pass props down. I see some major refractoring in my future. 

### R1D11
Had to rethink the organization of my category and questions. 

### R1D12
Was able to succesfully seperate my data according to id on the frontend and started displaying questions. Doesn't look pretty but progress is progress.
