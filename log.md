# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 15, Monday, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Successfully installed JEST to start testing my code 

**Thoughts** This is my first time actually writing test for my code and using JEST. I still have a lot more to learn about it but we'll see how it goes. So far I need to figure out to setup my testing environment.

### Day 2: June 16, Tuesday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Watched some videos about testing with Jest. Also read some documentation on the Jest website. I started adjusting my code so I can start testing but something is still giving me errors. 

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how setting this up is going to work. I hope I won't have to scrap my whole project and start over.

### Day 3: June 17, Wednesday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: After watching the video below again and still having no success in getting the test to configure, decided that it was time I started from scratch. So thats exactly what I did. I'm happy to report that after reading some REACT, JEST, ENZYME documentation, so far I have been able to install, configure, and successfully run some practice test.  

**Thoughts:** Not too happy about having to start all over but nevertheless excited to be starting something I haven't tried in depth before.

### Day 4: June 18, Thursday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Following a react, jest, enzyme tutorial to learn how to use them all together to test my code. But also adjusting some of the code shown in the video to match the project I'm trying to build. Specifically I wanted to use Semantic UI React for styling but it doesn't play well with jest and enzyme. I had to learn that through trial and error. So as an end result I have to brush up on my HTML and CSS.   

**Thoughts:** Happy that I'm slowly starting to get the hang of TDD but, still alot to learn so..yeah.

### Day 5: June 19, Friday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to post this yesterday. But I am in the process of learning more about jest and enyzme and how they work. I also am trying to figure out what other programs I want to implement in my app. So far I have configured react-router-dom.   

**Thoughts:** Happy installing react-router-dom didn't break jest and enzyme.

### Day 6: June 20, Saturday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little more about enzyme and how it simplifies full dom rendering. Also added some basic test to two of my components. Lastly did a little bit of refractoring.    

**Thoughts:** I need to find more tutorials about jest and enzyme so I can take full advantage of their cababilities.
