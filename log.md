# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 15, Monday, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Successfully installed JEST to start testing my code 

**Thoughts** This is my first time actually writing test for my code and using JEST. I still have a lot more to learn about it but we'll see how it goes. So far I need to figure out to setup my testing environment.

### Day 2: June 16, Tuesday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Watched some videos about testing with Jest. Also read some documentation on the Jest website. I started adjusting my code so I can start testing but something is still giving me errors. 

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how setting this up is going to work. I hope I won't have to scrap my whole project and start over.

### Day 3: June 17, Wendsday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: After watching the video below again and still having no success in getting the test to configure, decided that it was time I started from scratch. So thats exactly what I did. I'm happy to report that after reading some REACT, JEST, ENZYME documentation, so far I have been able to install, configure, and successfully run some practice test.  

**Thoughts:** Not too happy about having to start all over but nevertheless excited to be starting something I haven't tried in depth before.
