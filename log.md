##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Successfully installed JEST to start testing my code 

**Thoughts** This is my first time actually writing test for my code and using JEST. I still have a lot more to learn about it but we'll see how it goes. So far I need to figure out to setup my testing environment.
